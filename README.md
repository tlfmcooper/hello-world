# hello-world

Hi there,
I'm Ali Kone and I live in Toronto, ON Canada. I'm graduating with a Master of Finance in June 2018 from Rotman School of Management. 
It is during my master that I became obsessed with everything programming. Python, Matlab, SQL, R, etc.
I hope that with all your help, I will be able to become an expert in all these programming languages to help me be a top performer in my field which I hope will be quantitative investing, risk management, financial engineering, etc.
